            <h2>Panthera</h2>
            <p>Panthera is a genus within the family Felidae that contains some of the most magnificent big cats in the world. The genus includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tiger (Panthera tigris)</li>
                <li>Lion (Panthera leo)</li>
                <li>Jaguar (Panthera onca)</li>
                <li>Leopard (Panthera pardus)</li>
                <li>Snow Leopard (Panthera uncia)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These species are characterized by their ability to roar, which is made possible by their specialized larynx and hyoid apparatus. They are apex predators and play crucial roles in their ecosystems. Most Panthera species are considered vulnerable or endangered due to habitat loss and human conflict.</p>
